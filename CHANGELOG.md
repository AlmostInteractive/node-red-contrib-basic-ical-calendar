> 27 June 2023

- Initial commit.  Config node works and self updates.  Sensor node works surprisingly well.  Haven't started the trigger node, but I kinda combined it into the sensor node.  I'll figure out if I want one or two nodes tomorrow... [`3f7e1ab`](https://github.com/AlmostInteractive/node-red-contrib-basic-ical-calendar/commit/3f7e1ab3e0379bd181ce575a3ce62adcd6aa8a48)
